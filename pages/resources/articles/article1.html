          <p>LaVeyan Satanism is one of the several distinct religions identifying itself as Satanic. Followers are atheists who stress dependence on the self rather than reliance on any outside power. It encourages <em>individualism, hedonism, materialism, ego, personal initiative, self-worth, and self-determinism.</em></p>

        <h2>An Exultation of Self</h2>
        <p> To the LaVeyan Satanist, Satan is a myth, just like God and other deities. Satan is also, however, incredibly symbolic. It represents all of those things within our natures that outsiders might tell us is dirty and unacceptable.
          The chant of ‚ÄúHail Satan!‚Äù is really saying ‚ÄúHail me!‚Äù It exalts the self and rejects the self-denying lessons of society.

        Finally, Satan represents rebellion, just as Satan rebelled against God in Christianity. Identifying oneself as a <span class="link">Satanists</span> to go against expectations, cultural norms, and religious creeds.

        <h2>Origin of LaVeyan Satanism </h2>
        <p>Anton LaVey officially formed the church of Satan on the night of April 30-May 1, 1966. He published the <em>Satanic Bible</em> in 1969</p>
        <p>The Church of Satan admits that early rituals were mostly mockeries of Christian ritual and reenactments of Christian folklore concerning the supposed behavior of Satanists. For example, upside down crosses, reading the Lord‚Äôs Prayer backward, using a nude woman as an altar, etc. </p> 
        <p>However, as the Church of Satan evolved it solidified its own specific messages and tailored its rituals around those messages. </p>

        <h2>Basic Beliefs </h2>
        <p>The Church of Satan promotes individuality and following your desires. At the core of the religion are three sets of principles which outline these beliefs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="link">The Nine Satanic Statements:</span><p>Included in the opening of the Satanic Bible as written by LaVey. These statements outline the fundamental beliefs.</p></li>
          <li><span class="link">The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth:</span><p>Written two years prior to the Satanic Bible, LaVey wrote these rules for members of the Church of Satan.</p></li>
          <li><span class="link">The Nine Satanic Sins:</span><p>From pretentiousness to herd conformity, LaVey outlined the unacceptable actions for members.</p></li>
        </ul>

          <h3>üí° The Biggest Sin</h3>
          <p>Yes, there are Nine Satanic Sins, and being a moron is the biggest of them all‚Äì not ignorance, that can be cured with learning, but 
            stupidity allows people to be manipulated, and to do only as they are told. The subsequent sins on the list are quite pragmatic. Satanism 
            also forbids: pretentiousness, herd conformity, lack of perspective and aesthetics, and counterproductive pride. A lot of the Church‚Äôs
             principles are fairly aligned with the law and, to some degree, other religions. One major difference is they support the idea of lex 
             talionis, or an eye for eye. So whoever strikes you on your right cheek, you go ahead and smack them on their left cheek. <em>That‚Äôs the
              Satanist‚Äôs way.</em></p>

        <h2>Holidays and Celebrations</h2>
        <p>Satanism celebrates the self, so one‚Äôs own birthday is held as the most important holiday. </p>
        <p>Satanists also sometimes celebrate the nights of Walpurgisnacht (April 30-May 1) and Halloween (October 31-November 1). These days have been traditionally associated with Satanists through witchcraft lore.</p>

        <h2>Misconceptions of Satanism</h2>
        <p>Satanism has been routinely accused of numerous onerous practices, generally without evidence. There is a common mistaken belief that because Satanists believe in serving themselves first, they become antisocial or even psychopathic. In truth, responsibility is a major tenet of Satanism.</p>
        <p>Humans have the right to do as they choose and should feel free to pursue their own happiness. However, this does not render them immune from consequences. Taking control of one‚Äôs life includes being responsible regarding one's actions. </p>
        <p>Among the things LaVey explicitly condemned: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Harming of children</li>
          <li>Rape</li>
          <li>Theft</li>
          <li>Illegal Activity</li>
          <li>Drug Use</li>
          <li>Animal Sacrifce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Satanic Panic</h2>
        <p>In the 1980s, rumors and accusations abounded about supposedly Satanic individuals ritually abusing children. Many of those suspected worked as teachers or daycare workers.</p>
        <p>After lengthy investigations, it was concluded that not only were the accused innocent but that the abuses never even happened. In addition, the suspects were not even associated with a Satanic practice.</p>
        <p>The Satanic Panic is a modern-day example of the power of mass hysteria.</p>
